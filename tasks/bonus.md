## Pro Tips 🎯

### Performance Optimization
- Compress images before deployment
- Minify CSS and JavaScript
- Use CDN for external libraries
- Enable gzip compression

### Security Best Practices
- Use HTTPS (most platforms provide this free)
- Set proper CORS headers
- Never expose API keys in frontend code
- Use environment variables for sensitive data

### Monitoring and Analytics
- Set up basic analytics (Google Analytics)
- Monitor uptime (UptimeRobot)
- Check performance (PageSpeed Insights)
- Monitor errors (Sentry for advanced users)

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Build Failures**: Check build logs carefully
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required vars are set
- **CORS Errors**: Configure CORS properly for API calls
- **404 Errors**: Set up proper routing for SPAs
- **SSL Issues**: Most platforms handle this automatically
